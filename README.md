Repository
- This repository was created for the exercise "11.20 Your own pipeline" from the FullStack Open Course given by the University of Helsinki.
  - [see here: https://fullstackopen.com/en/part11/expanding_further#exercises-11-19-11-21]
- The app is a copy-and-paste of the blog-list backend and frontend done for parts 4 and 5 of the online course, with certain modifications to make it work correctly.

Deployments
- The backend is deployed on Render at [https://univ-helsinki-fullstack-exercise-11-20.onrender.com].
- The frontend is deployed on Render at [https://univ-helsinki-fullstack-exercise-11-20-yxp7.onrender.com].
